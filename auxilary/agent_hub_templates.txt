            RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
            ----------------------------
            
            When responding to me, please output a response in one of two formats:
            
            **Option 1:**
            Use this if you want the human to use a tool.
            Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
            
            ```json
            {{
                    "action": string, \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
                    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action
            }}
            ```
            
            **Option #2:**
            Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
            
            ```json
            {{
                "action": "Final Answer",
